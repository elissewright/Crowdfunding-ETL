# **Crowdfunding Data Analysis**
## This project uses a multi-step Extract-Transform-Load process to analyze crowdfunding data: 
* Python to clean and concatenate data from multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame and export it into a new CSV
* SQL to analyze the data from the cleaned CSV file and produce tables and CSV files with results of analysis.
